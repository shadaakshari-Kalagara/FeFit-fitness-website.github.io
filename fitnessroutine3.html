      <p1>WEEK 1</p1>
        <p>1 Running the stairs strengthens your legs, improves cardio health, improves stamina and enagages your core msucles.</p>

  <li>Start by warming up your muscles doing some light stretches.</li>
  <li>Starting walking up and down the stairs and slowly increase your pace</li>

         <div> 
<p> 2 . Crunches are a classic core-strengthening move. The act of lifting your upper body works your abdominal muscles.

If you have low back pain, do crunches with care. Move slowly and start with just a few reps</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Start on your back. Bend your knees and plant your feet on the floor at hip width. Line up your head and spine. Cross your arms across your chest.</li>
            
        <li>Tighten your core and relax your neck and shoulders. Tuck in your chin and lift your upper back, keeping your lower back, pelvis, and feet on the floor. Pause.</li>
        <li>Slowly lower your upper back to return to the starting position.</li>
        <li>Start with 1 set of 8–12 reps.</li></ul>

        </div>
<p> 3 Burpees are a challenging exercise that work many of the major muscle groups in your body.</p><ul>
        <li>Start in a squat position with your knees bent, back straight, and your feet about shoulder-width apart.</li>
        <li>Lower your hands to the floor in front of you so they’re just inside your feet</li>
        <li>With your weight on your hands, kick your feet back so you’re on your hands and toes, and in a pushup position.</li>
        <li>Keeping your body straight from head to heels, do one pushup. Remember not to let your back sag or to stick your butt in the air.</li>
        <li>Do a frog kick by jumping your feet back to their starting position.</li>
        <li>Stand and reach your arms over your head.</li>
        <li>Jump quickly into the air so you land back where you started.</li>
        <li>As soon as you land with knees bent, get into a squat position and do another repetition.</li></ul>

        <p1>WEEK 2</p1>
        <p> 1 . The Supine Toe Tap is a basic Pilates exercise. It engages your core muscles while working your glutes, hips, and legs.

Toe taps also place minimal pressure on your spine. If you have back pain, toe taps may be an ideal alternative to crunches.

</p>
<div> 
    <p> 2 . Skipping not only strengthens your core and legs but also helps with weight-loss and cardio health.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Start with your hands in the "ready" position. Grip the handles loosely with your fingers, not your palms.</li>
                
            <li>Practice a toe catch. Place the rope behind you and turn the jump rope over your head. Catch the jump rope under your toes and lift up your heels and let it out from underneath your feet. Repeat this movements until you become comfortable</li>
            <li>Pretend jump. Jumping rope is all about timing the turn of the rope with your jump. Try taking an imaginary jump rope and pretending to turn it over your head and jump rope with it.</li>
            <li> Now it’s time to try with a real jump rope. Be patient with yourself and go slow. </li>
            <li>Start with 1 set of 30-40 reps.</li></ul>
